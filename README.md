# Hyperion Dev Level 1 Capstone 1 - Variables and Control Structures
A program to allow the user to access two different financial calculators: an
investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

## Menu
User is allowed to choose which calculation they want to do by choosing either
'investment' or 'bond'.

## Investment
If the user selects 'investment', they are prompted to enter the following:

- The amount of money that they are depositing
- The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number
of the interest rate should be entered — don’t worry
about having to deal with the added ‘%’
- The number of years they plan on investing for
- Whether they want to calculate 'simple' or 'compound' interest

## Bond
If the user selects 'bond', they are prompted to enter the following:

- The present value of the house
- The interest rate. E.g. 7
- The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond
